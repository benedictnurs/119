Cloud computing in AWS:

- Getting started; what to know up front

- Storing data (S3)

If we have an extra 10-20 minutes at the end of class, I will reserve it for an open Q+A.

## Poll

Getting the poll out of the way:

https://forms.gle/3e6vJHShMJfaD2pH8

Given this information, what is the minimum and maximum latency for individual input rows?
