## Plan

- Start with the poll

Then, we're going to switch gears a bit for Lecture 4:

- Motivation: scaling your application

- Key definitions: parallel, concurrent, and distributed computing

- Parallel thinking and Amdahl's Law

Note:

- If you wish, you may finish the Lecture 3 notes on your own time.

## Oct 23

Announcements:

- HW1 due Friday

- Office hours poll

Plan:

- Poll

- Continue: parallel, concurrent, and distributed computing; main concepts

- Parallel thinking: types of parallelism, quantifying parallelism, Amdahl's law

## Oct 25

Announcements:

- HW1 due today

- Reminder: No class on Monday.
