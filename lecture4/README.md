## Plan

- Start with the poll

Then, we're going to switch gears a bit for Lecture 4:

- Motivation: scaling your application

- Key definitions: parallel, concurrent, and distributed computing

- Parallel thinking and Amdahl's Law

Note:

- If you wish, you may finish the Lecture 3 notes on your own time.
