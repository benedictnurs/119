  Worth 1 point of extra credit if completed.
  (Make sure you fill out the second form, link available after the first one is completed, to get the extra credit.)

  Please do fill it out! I appreciate all of your feedback and
  use it to make changes (both this year and next year).
  This is especially helpful as this is a new course and much
  of the content is still in flux as to what is most important
  to cover.

  Study questions: go over the in-class polls!

  Midterm is o closed-book, on paper!

  You are allowed a one-sided cheat sheet.
  Handwritten or typed is OK.

  No questions that ask you to hand-write code
  (concepts, not syntax)
