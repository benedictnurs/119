# Lecture 2: The Shell

## Oct 7 (Monday)

Announcements:

- HW0 and participation grades posted

- You can receive partial credit for submitting HW0 late.
  HW0 is used to associate your email with your name/ID, so you
  will need to submit HW0 before seeing any of your participation scores.

- Questions?

Plan for today:

- Poll

- Cleaned up example from last time: Throughput & Latency

- Start lecture 2

  + Lecture 2 will focus on the shell (your terminal)

Looking forward:
return to data processing in Pandas starting from Lecture 3
(input validation, cleaning, data wrangling, transformations, scraping, etc.)
parallel/distributed data processing as soon as possible but likely
not until halfway through the quarter.

### Poll

What are the units of throughput?

Finishing some definitions:

- Throughput = ...

- Often calculated as:

- Latency = ...

- Often calculated as:

For a cleaned up example, see lecture1/throughput_latency.py.

These concepts and terminology are fundamental in computer networking.
For example, you may have seen wifi network advertised in terms of
throughput or bandwidth in Mbps:

We will come back to this later on!
For now: the fundamental performance characteristics of ANY data processing
pipeline can be summarized by throughput and latency.
